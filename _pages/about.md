The Behavioural Ecology and Evolution Group is a team of dedicated scientists who are interested in studying the behavior of animals, how it relates to their ecology and how it has evolved over time. Our team is made up of researchers from a variety of backgrounds and nationalities, , and we use a variety of methods to study the behavior of animals in the wild and in controlled laboratory environments.

Our research focuses on understanding the mechanisms underlying animal behavior, and how these behaviors have evolved. We are particularly interested in studying how animals make decisions, how animals communicate, and how they form social relationships.

Our team has a long history of conducting field research, and we have conducted studies in a variety of locations around the world, including the Great Barrier Reef (Lizard Island, Australia), endemism centers (Oahu, Hawaii and Moorea, French Polynesia), Atlantic estuaries (Tejo and Sado, Portugal). We also have a state-of-the-art laboratory for behavioural and cognitive research (in Laboratório Marítimo da Guia, Cascais, Portugal) where we conduct experiments to study the behavior of animals in controlled environments.

In addition to our research, we are committed to sharing our findings with the broader scientific community. We also engage with the public to help educate people about our research and the importance of studying animal behavior.

If you are interested in learning more about our research or joining our team, please email us at jrpaula@fc.ul.pt. We would be happy to hear from you!
